# v3.0 Migration - Next Steps

## Current Status
The v3.0 migration is structurally complete with all modules migrated to the new architecture. However, there's a runtime module resolution issue with TypeScript path mappings (`@/` imports) that needs to be addressed.

## Path Resolution Issue
The compiled JavaScript still contains `@/modules` imports which Node.js cannot resolve at runtime. This is a common issue with TypeScript path mappings.

## Solutions to Implement

### Option 1: Use a Path Mapping Resolver (Recommended)
Install and configure `tsconfig-paths` or `tsc-alias` to resolve paths at runtime:

```bash
pnpm add -D tsc-alias
```

Then update build script to:
```bash
tsc && tsc-alias
```

### Option 2: Use Relative Imports
Convert all `@/` imports to relative imports (more maintenance but guaranteed to work).

### Option 3: Use a Bundler
Switch to using a bundler like esbuild or rollup that can resolve path mappings.

## For Now: Legacy Fallback Available
The legacy v2.0 implementation remains fully functional:
- `pnpm run legacy:start` for full workflow
- Individual legacy scripts work independently

## Architecture Verification ✅
- All TypeScript types compile correctly
- All modules are properly structured
- Interface-driven design is complete
- Error handling is centralized
- Configuration is migrated

## Migration Completion Status
- **Structure**: ✅ Complete
- **Type Safety**: ✅ Complete  
- **Architecture**: ✅ Complete
- **Runtime**: ⚠️ Needs path resolution fix

The v3.0 migration is essentially complete from an architectural standpoint. Only the runtime path resolution needs to be addressed for full functionality.
