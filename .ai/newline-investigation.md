# Newline Issue Investigation Results

**Date**: 2025-06-19  
**Investigation**: Complete codebase scan for `\\n` problems  
**Status**: ✅ **ALL CLEAR**

## Investigation Summary

We searched the entire codebase for potential `\\n` (double-backslash newline) problems that would cause literal `\n` to appear in console output instead of actual newlines.

## Search Results

### Files Checked
- **Total TypeScript files scanned**: All `src/**/*.ts` files
- **Files with normal `\n` patterns**: 16 files
- **Files with problematic `\\n` patterns**: **0 files**

### Search Commands Used
```bash
# Search for problematic double-backslash patterns
find src -name "*.ts" -exec grep -l "\\\\n" {} \;

# Count normal vs problematic patterns
find src -name "*.ts" -exec grep -l '\\n' {} \; | wc -l     # 16 files (normal)
find src -name "*.ts" -exec grep -l '\\\\n' {} \; | wc -l   # 0 files (problematic)
```

## Findings

✅ **No remaining `\\n` issues found**
- All newline patterns in the codebase are correct (`\n`)
- Previous fix in `src/index.ts` resolved all the issues
- Console output should display proper newlines everywhere

## Files with Normal Newlines (✅ Correct)
The 16 files containing `\n` patterns are using them correctly for:
- Console.log formatting
- String formatting in templates
- Help text and error messages
- CSS generation

## Conclusion

**No sed fix needed** - the codebase is clean! 

The original issue was isolated to `src/index.ts` and has been completely resolved. All other files were already using correct newline formatting.

## Verification

To verify console output works correctly across the codebase:
```bash
# Test main help
node dist/index.js --help

# Test CLI help  
pnpm run cli:help

# Test CLI commands (they should show clean newlines)
pnpm run cli:build --help
```

All output should display proper newlines without any literal `\n` characters.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

No further action needed. The codebase has clean, properly formatted console output throughout.
