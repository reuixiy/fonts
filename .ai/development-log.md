## Issues and Solutions

### Issue #1: Network Connectivity
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Version checker failing with connection errors (ECONNREFUSED 0.0.0.0:443)  
**Status**: Identified - requires GitHub token setup  
**Solution**: Set GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable for API access

### Issue #2: Font Processing Dependencies
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: pyftsubset command not found  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Installed fonttools using `brew install fonttools`

### Issue #3: Missing Download Metadata
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Font subsetting fails because download metadata doesn't exist  
**Status**: Expected behavior - fonts need to be downloaded first  
**Solution**: Ensure proper workflow order: download → subset → generate CSS

### Issue #4: GitHub Actions Package Manager Mismatch
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: GitHub Actions failing with "Dependencies lock file is not found" - looking for package-lock.json but project uses pnpm  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Updated GitHub Actions workflows to use pnpm instead of npm:
- Added pnpm/action-setup@v4 
- Changed `npm ci` to `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- Updated all `npm run` commands to `pnpm run`
- Ensured pnpm-lock.yaml is committed to repository

### Issue #5: Complex Manual Git Deployment
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Manual git operations in GitHub Actions for deployment are complex and error-prone  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Replaced manual git operations with `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` action:
- Simplified deployment to build branch
- Automatic orphan branch handling
- More reliable and maintainable
- Built-in error handling and retry logic

### Issue #6: GitHub Actions Deprecated Commands
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: GitHub Actions `::set-output` command deprecated, causing warnings in workflow runs  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Migrated to new Environment Files (`GITHUB_OUTPUT`) method:
- Replaced `echo "::set-output name=key::value"` with `echo "key=value" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT`
- Updated `versionChecker.js` to write outputs to `GITHUB_OUTPUT` file instead of stdout
- Maintained backward compatibility for local development
- Fixed all deprecation warnings in GitHub Actions

### Issue #7: Version Cache Persistence
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Version cache lost between GitHub Actions runs, causing unnecessary rebuilds  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Implemented git-based orphan `cache` branch for persistent version cache:
- Created dedicated orphan branch containing only `version-cache.json`
- Version checker now fetches/updates cache from this branch automatically
- Ensures persistent cache across workflow runs without affecting main branch
- Proper error handling for missing cache or branch scenarios

### Issue #8: Font File Download Validation
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Downloaded font files sometimes empty due to API rate limits or network issues  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Added comprehensive file validation to download process:
- File size validation (minimum thresholds for different font types)
- Font file format validation (checking headers for TTF/OTF signatures)
- Automatic cleanup of invalid files
- Detailed error reporting for debugging
- Enhanced logging for successful validations

### Issue #9: Octokit File Path Handling
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Special characters in font file paths causing download failures  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Maintained Octokit-based approach with improved error handling:
- Proper base64 decoding for repo file downloads
- Enhanced path validation and error messages
- Better handling of GitHub API responses
- Confirmed working approach for complex file paths

### Issue #10: Node.js Buffer Deprecation Warning
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: `response.buffer()` method deprecated in node-fetch, causing warnings  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Migrated to modern `response.arrayBuffer()` method:
- Replaced `response.buffer()` with `response.arrayBuffer()` and `Buffer.from(arrayBuffer)`
- Updated both GitHub release and repository download methods
- Eliminated deprecation warnings while maintaining functionality

### Issue #11: Large Font File Download Limitation
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: GitHub API content endpoint limited to 1MB, causing empty downloads for large font files like Amstelvar (1.4MB)  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Implemented hybrid download strategy:
- Automatic detection of large files (>1MB) or Git LFS files
- Fallback to direct raw GitHub URLs for large files
- Proper URL encoding for special characters in file paths
- Maintained base64 decoding for smaller files
- Enhanced debugging information for troubleshooting

### Issue #12: Redundant File Downloads
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Script re-downloading existing valid font files on every run  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Added comprehensive file existence checking:
- Pre-download validation of existing files
- Reuse of existing `validateDownloadedFile` method for consistency
- Skip download if valid file already exists
- Clear logging when files are skipped
- Maintains download metadata consistency

**Last Updated**: June 17, 2025  
**Next Review**: Project Complete - Ready for Production

## 2025-06-17 - Final Implementation and Optimizations

### CLI Argument Parsing Fix
- **Issue**: `pnpm start -- --build-only` was only showing usage help instead of executing build
- **Root Cause**: npm/pnpm passes `--` as literal argument, causing `args[0]` to be `--` instead of `--build-only`
- **Solution**: Updated argument parsing in `src/index.js` to check both `args[0]` and `args[1]` for options
- **Fix**: Modified module execution detection to properly handle npm/pnpm script execution
- **Result**: All CLI modes now work correctly: default, `--build-only`, `--fonts <id>`

### Font Subsetting Optimization
- **Feature**: Skip font subsetting when output files already exist
- **Implementation**: Added file existence checks in `processChineseFont()` and `processVariableFont()`
- **Benefits**: 
  - Dramatically improves workflow speed on subsequent runs (seconds vs minutes)
  - Perfect for incremental builds and development iterations
  - Maintains same output structure and metadata generation
- **Output**: Shows "⏭️ File already exists" message with file size for skipped files

### Code Cleanup
- **Removed**: Unused temp directory creation and cleanup from download scripts
- **Updated**: `clean-cache.sh` script to remove temp directory references
- **Updated**: `.gitignore` to remove temp/ entry
- **Updated**: Documentation in `.ai/cache-cleaning-guide.md`

### Selective Font Building Fix
- **Critical Issue**: `build-fonts.yml` was always building all fonts, ignoring `updated-fonts` parameter
- **Problem**: Version check workflow correctly identified updated fonts but build workflow ignored this
- **Impact**: Wasteful - every version check triggered full rebuild of all fonts instead of just updated ones
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified build step to check `updated-fonts` parameter
  - Use `--fonts <ids>` for selective builds when specific fonts updated
  - Use `--build-only` for full builds when parameter is "all" or empty
  - Added comma-to-space conversion for multiple font IDs
- **Benefits**:
  - Dramatically reduced build time and resource usage
  - Only processes fonts that actually have updates
  - Maintains full functionality for manual builds
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better metadata tracking and commit messages showing build type

### Current Status
✅ **COMPLETED**: Full automated web font subsetting workflow
✅ **VERIFIED**: All CLI modes working correctly
✅ **OPTIMIZED**: Skip processing for existing files
✅ **CLEANED**: Removed unused code and directories
✅ **DOCUMENTED**: All changes recorded and committed

The system is now production-ready with:
- Robust error handling and logging
