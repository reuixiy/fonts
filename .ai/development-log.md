## Issues and Solutions

### Issue #1: Network Connectivity
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Version checker failing with connection errors (ECONNREFUSED 0.0.0.0:443)  
**Status**: Identified - requires GitHub token setup  
**Solution**: Set GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable for API access

### Issue #2: Font Processing Dependencies
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: pyftsubset command not found  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Installed fonttools using `brew install fonttools`

### Issue #3: Missing Download Metadata
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Font subsetting fails because download metadata doesn't exist  
**Status**: Expected behavior - fonts need to be downloaded first  
**Solution**: Ensure proper workflow order: download → subset → generate CSS

### Issue #4: GitHub Actions Package Manager Mismatch
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: GitHub Actions failing with "Dependencies lock file is not found" - looking for package-lock.json but project uses pnpm  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Updated GitHub Actions workflows to use pnpm instead of npm:
- Added pnpm/action-setup@v4 
- Changed `npm ci` to `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- Updated all `npm run` commands to `pnpm run`
- Ensured pnpm-lock.yaml is committed to repository

### Issue #5: Complex Manual Git Deployment
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Manual git operations in GitHub Actions for deployment are complex and error-prone  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Replaced manual git operations with `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` action:
- Simplified deployment to build branch
- Automatic orphan branch handling
- More reliable and maintainable
- Built-in error handling and retry logic

### Issue #6: GitHub Actions Deprecated Commands
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: GitHub Actions `::set-output` command deprecated, causing warnings in workflow runs  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Migrated to new Environment Files (`GITHUB_OUTPUT`) method:
- Replaced `echo "::set-output name=key::value"` with `echo "key=value" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT`
- Updated `versionChecker.js` to write outputs to `GITHUB_OUTPUT` file instead of stdout
- Maintained backward compatibility for local development
- Fixed all deprecation warnings in GitHub Actions

### Issue #7: Version Cache Persistence
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Version cache lost between GitHub Actions runs, causing unnecessary rebuilds  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Implemented git-based orphan `cache` branch for persistent version cache:
- Created dedicated orphan branch containing only `version-cache.json`
- Version checker now fetches/updates cache from this branch automatically
- Ensures persistent cache across workflow runs without affecting main branch
- Proper error handling for missing cache or branch scenarios

### Issue #8: Font File Download Validation
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Downloaded font files sometimes empty due to API rate limits or network issues  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Added comprehensive file validation to download process:
- File size validation (minimum thresholds for different font types)
- Font file format validation (checking headers for TTF/OTF signatures)
- Automatic cleanup of invalid files
- Detailed error reporting for debugging
- Enhanced logging for successful validations

### Issue #9: Octokit File Path Handling
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Special characters in font file paths causing download failures  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Maintained Octokit-based approach with improved error handling:
- Proper base64 decoding for repo file downloads
- Enhanced path validation and error messages
- Better handling of GitHub API responses
- Confirmed working approach for complex file paths

### Issue #10: Node.js Buffer Deprecation Warning
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: `response.buffer()` method deprecated in node-fetch, causing warnings  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Migrated to modern `response.arrayBuffer()` method:
- Replaced `response.buffer()` with `response.arrayBuffer()` and `Buffer.from(arrayBuffer)`
- Updated both GitHub release and repository download methods
- Eliminated deprecation warnings while maintaining functionality

### Issue #11: Large Font File Download Limitation
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: GitHub API content endpoint limited to 1MB, causing empty downloads for large font files like Amstelvar (1.4MB)  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Implemented hybrid download strategy:
- Automatic detection of large files (>1MB) or Git LFS files
- Fallback to direct raw GitHub URLs for large files
- Proper URL encoding for special characters in file paths
- Maintained base64 decoding for smaller files
- Enhanced debugging information for troubleshooting

### Issue #12: Redundant File Downloads
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Script re-downloading existing valid font files on every run  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Added comprehensive file existence checking:
- Pre-download validation of existing files
- Reuse of existing `validateDownloadedFile` method for consistency
- Skip download if valid file already exists
- Clear logging when files are skipped
- Maintains download metadata consistency
