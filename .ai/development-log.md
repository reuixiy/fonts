## Issues and Solutions

### Issue #1: Network Connectivity
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Version checker failing with connection errors (ECONNREFUSED 0.0.0.0:443)  
**Status**: Identified - requires GitHub token setup  
**Solution**: Set GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable for API access

### Issue #2: Font Processing Dependencies
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: pyftsubset command not found  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Solution**: Installed fonttools using `brew install fonttools`

### Issue #3: Missing Download Metadata
**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Font subsetting fails because download metadata doesn't exist  
**Status**: Expected behavior - fonts need to be downloaded first  
**Solution**: Ensure proper workflow order: download → subset → generate CSS

## Resolved Issues

### ✅ Project Structure Setup
- Created complete Node.js project with proper dependencies
- Configured ESM modules and import/export syntax
- Set up comprehensive configuration system

### ✅ Core Module Implementation
- Version checking with GitHub API integration
- Font downloading from GitHub releases and repositories
- Font subsetting with fonttools integration
- CSS generation with @font-face declarations
- Workflow orchestration with error handling

### ✅ GitHub Actions Integration
- Daily version checking workflow
- Automated build and deployment pipeline
- Orphan branch deployment strategy
- Proper environment setup and dependency installation

## Performance Metrics
*To be recorded during development*

## Dependencies and Tools

### Planned Dependencies
- **Node.js Packages**:
  - `@octokit/rest` - GitHub API client
  - `node-fetch` - HTTP requests
  - `fs-extra` - File system utilities
  - `commander` - CLI interface

- **Python Packages**:
  - `fonttools` - Font processing
  - `brotli` - WOFF2 compression

### Development Tools
