**Last Updated**: June 17, 2025  
**Next Review**: Project Complete - Ready for Production

## 2025-06-17 - Final Implementation and Optimizations

### CLI Argument Parsing Fix
- **Issue**: `pnpm start -- --build-only` was only showing usage help instead of executing build
- **Root Cause**: npm/pnpm passes `--` as literal argument, causing `args[0]` to be `--` instead of `--build-only`
- **Solution**: Updated argument parsing in `src/index.js` to check both `args[0]` and `args[1]` for options
- **Fix**: Modified module execution detection to properly handle npm/pnpm script execution
- **Result**: All CLI modes now work correctly: default, `--build-only`, `--fonts <id>`

### Font Subsetting Optimization
- **Feature**: Skip font subsetting when output files already exist
- **Implementation**: Added file existence checks in `processChineseFont()` and `processVariableFont()`
- **Benefits**: 
  - Dramatically improves workflow speed on subsequent runs (seconds vs minutes)
  - Perfect for incremental builds and development iterations
  - Maintains same output structure and metadata generation
- **Output**: Shows "⏭️ File already exists" message with file size for skipped files

### Code Cleanup
- **Removed**: Unused temp directory creation and cleanup from download scripts
- **Updated**: `clean-cache.sh` script to remove temp directory references
- **Updated**: `.gitignore` to remove temp/ entry
- **Updated**: Documentation in `.ai/cache-cleaning-guide.md`

### Selective Font Building Fix
- **Critical Issue**: `build-fonts.yml` was always building all fonts, ignoring `updated-fonts` parameter
- **Problem**: Version check workflow correctly identified updated fonts but build workflow ignored this
- **Impact**: Wasteful - every version check triggered full rebuild of all fonts instead of just updated ones
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified build step to check `updated-fonts` parameter
  - Use `--fonts <ids>` for selective builds when specific fonts updated
  - Use `--build-only` for full builds when parameter is "all" or empty
  - Added comma-to-space conversion for multiple font IDs
- **Benefits**:
  - Dramatically reduced build time and resource usage
  - Only processes fonts that actually have updates
  - Maintains full functionality for manual builds
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better metadata tracking and commit messages showing build type

### Current Status
✅ **COMPLETED**: Full automated web font subsetting workflow
✅ **VERIFIED**: All CLI modes working correctly
✅ **OPTIMIZED**: Skip processing for existing files
✅ **CLEANED**: Removed unused code and directories
✅ **DOCUMENTED**: All changes recorded and committed

The system is now production-ready with:
- Robust error handling and logging
- Efficient incremental processing
- Complete automation via GitHub Actions
- Modern tooling (pnpm, ESM modules)
- Comprehensive documentation

## 2025-06-17 - Size-Based Font Chunking Implementation

### Major Feature Addition: Google Fonts-Style Chunking
- **Challenge**: Current single-file subsetting doesn't optimize web loading performance
- **Solution**: Implement size-based font chunking similar to Google Fonts approach
- **Strategy**: Split fonts into multiple chunks based on target file sizes and character frequency

### Size-Based Chunking Design
- **Algorithm**: Character frequency analysis + size-based splitting
- **Chinese Font Strategy**:
  - Chunk 0 (80KB): Critical characters (Latin, punctuation) for immediate rendering
  - Chunks 1-5 (150KB each): High-frequency Chinese characters (80%+ coverage)
  - Chunks 6-15 (200KB each): Medium-frequency characters
  - Remaining chunks (250KB each): Rare and specialized characters
- **Progressive Loading**: Browsers automatically load only needed character ranges
- **Complete Coverage**: Validation ensures no characters are lost during chunking

### Technical Implementation Plan
1. **Font Analysis**: Extract all supported characters from original fonts
2. **Priority Ranking**: Apply frequency-based character sorting for Chinese fonts
3. **Size-Based Splitting**: Create chunks targeting specific file sizes
4. **CSS Generation**: Multiple @font-face rules with unicode-range declarations
5. **Coverage Validation**: Ensure all original characters are preserved

### Configuration Updates
- New chunking configuration in `fonts.json`
- Configurable chunk sizes and strategies
- Character frequency data integration
- Complete coverage validation flags

### Expected Benefits
- ✅ **Faster Initial Loading**: Critical characters render immediately
- ✅ **Progressive Enhancement**: Additional characters load on-demand
- ✅ **Bandwidth Optimization**: Only downloads needed character ranges
- ✅ **Better Mobile Performance**: Smaller initial payload
- ✅ **Google Fonts Parity**: Industry-standard chunking approach

## 2025-06-18 - CSS Generation & Download Fixes

### CSS Generation Improvements ✅
**Problem**: CSS output had inconsistent structure and missing license information
**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Import-Based Structure**: 
  - `fonts.css` now uses `@import './fontname.css'` statements
  - `fonts.min.css` uses `@import './fontname.min.css'` statements
  - Clean import-only structure without inline CSS
- **License Headers**: 
  - All individual CSS files include proper license headers
  - Font name, license type, license URL, generation date
  - Unified files reference individual file licenses
- **Removed Utility Classes**: 
  - Eliminated unwanted `.font-chinese`, `.font-{fontname}` utility classes
  - Clean CSS focused only on @font-face declarations

### Font Download System Fixes ✅
**Problem**: Amstelvar font downloads failing with corrupted/empty files
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent URL construction for GitHub raw files
**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Fixed GitHub Raw URLs**: Proper `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL construction
- **URL Encoding**: Proper encoding for special characters (square brackets in filenames)
- **Consistent Structure**: All fonts download to `downloads/{fontId}/` subdirectories
- **Enhanced Validation**: Better file validation to detect corrupted downloads

### Results ✅
- **Amstelvar**: Both Roman and Italic variants download correctly
- **CSS Structure**: Clean import-based CSS with proper licensing
- **File Organization**: Consistent subdirectory structure for all fonts
- **Documentation**: Updated README and development log

### Technical Details
- **URL Construction**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/main/{path}`
- **Path Encoding**: `encodeURIComponent(path).replace(/%2F/g, '/')`
- **License Headers**: CSS comments with `/*!` to prevent minification removal
- **Import Structure**: Relative paths with `./` prefix for better portability
