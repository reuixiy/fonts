### v3.0 - Modular Architecture
**Date**: June 18-19, 2025

Complete architectural overhaul:

#### Modular Design
- Interface-driven development with dependency injection
- Feature-based modules: `version/`, `download/`, `subset/`, `css/`, `docs/`
- Service container for centralized dependency management
- TypeScript-based configuration system

#### Enhanced CLI
- Command-based interface: `build`, `check`, `subset`, `css`, `docs`, `clean`
- Global npm package with CLI binary
- Comprehensive argument parsing and help system
- Font selection with `--fonts` flag

#### Improved Processing
- Migrated from Python fonttools to npm libraries (subset-font, fontkit)
- Simplified build process without Python dependencies
- Better chunk metadata generation
- Enhanced error handling and logging

#### Technical Improvements
- Legacy code cleanup and removal
- Path resolution with tsc-alias
- Consistent service interfaces
- Better code organization and documentation

### v4.0 - Modern Font Processing Migration
